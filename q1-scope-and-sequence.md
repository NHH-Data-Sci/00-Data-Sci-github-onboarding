# 🤖 Quarter 1 Scope & Sequence – Data Science with AI

This quarter focuses entirely on Artificial Intelligence.  
Students will explore what AI is, how it works, how it thinks, and how to use it **responsibly** and **critically**.  
All assignments are designed to fit into a 5-day week:
- **Monday**: Offline mapping & journaling
- **Tues–Thurs**: Core AI Lab work
- **Friday**: Biweekly quizzes + Future Friday reading/discussion

## 📘 Quarter 1 Final Project (Week 9)

Students will:
- Select a challenging article or excerpt from an academic or professional source
- Use **Scientist AI prompting** (not “Do it for me” style)
- Work with the AI to:
  - Identify key ideas
  - Rephrase complex ideas in accessible language
  - Compare summaries, ask for analogies, or define technical terms
- Submit a final Markdown file that includes:
  - The original source (or excerpt)
  - Their prompt(s)
  - The AI’s response(s)
  - Their own reflections: What worked? What was lost or gained in simplification?

### 🔧 Assessment Focus:
- Clarity and accuracy of simplified explanation  
- Evidence of iterative, thoughtful prompting  
- Final version shows understanding, not just copying  
- Clear distinction between AI’s voice and student’s voice

## 🧪 Assessment & Reflection

| Component             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Biweekly Quizzes** | Based on concepts from previous 2 weeks (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8) |
| **Future Friday**    | Reading + written reflection on real-world AI topics |
| **Weekly Journals**  | Monday planning + Friday reflections (Tech-free) |
| **AI Lab Submissions** | Saved as Markdown files inside GitHub assignment repos |
| **Quarter 2 Prep**   | Students will select their favorite prompt as a seed for a Q2 mock data project |

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- Prompt clarity and iteration  
- Reflection and critique of AI output  
- Ethical awareness of AI use and bias  
- Technical familiarity with offline AI tools (e.g., Ollama)
- Responsible use of AI as a **thinking tool**, not a substitute for thinking
