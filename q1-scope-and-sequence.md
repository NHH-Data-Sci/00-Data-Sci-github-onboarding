# Quarter 1 Scope & Sequence ‚Äì Data Science with AI

This quarter focuses entirely on Artificial Intelligence.  
Students will explore what AI is, how it works, how it thinks, and how to use it **responsibly** and **critically**.  
All assignments are designed to fit into a 5-day week:
- **Monday**: Offline mapping & journaling
- **Tues‚ÄìThurs**: Core AI Lab work
- **Friday**: Biweekly quizzes + Future Friday reading/discussion

## üìò Quarter 1 Final Project (Week 9)

Students will Create a 1 article RAG:
- Select a challenging article or excerpt from an academic or professional source
- Use **Scientist AI prompting** (not ‚ÄúDo it for me‚Äù style)
- Work with the AI to:
  - Identify key ideas
  - Rephrase complex ideas in accessible language
  - Compare summaries, ask for analogies, or define technical terms
- Submit a final Markdown file that includes:
  - The original source (or excerpt)
  - Their prompt(s)
  - The AI‚Äôs response(s)
  - Their own reflections: What worked? What was lost or gained in simplification?

### üîß Assessment Focus:
- Clarity and accuracy of simplified explanation  
- Evidence of iterative, thoughtful prompting  
- Final version shows understanding, not just copying  
- Clear distinction between AI‚Äôs voice and student‚Äôs voice
