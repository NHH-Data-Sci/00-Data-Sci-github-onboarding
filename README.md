## 🪑 Seating Chart

In this course, each student will be assigned a dedicated computer for all in-class work involving AI tools, spreadsheets, and project files.

- You must choose a permanent seat by the end of the first week of class.

- Your assigned device will be tied to your unique login and saved work.

- Once the seating chart is finalized, you must remain in that seat for the rest of the semester.

- Moving to a different computer may result in being unable to access your work or submit assignments.

- This system ensures consistency, security, and fair access to your learning tools.
